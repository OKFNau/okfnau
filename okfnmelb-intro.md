## Open Knowledge Introduction
Hi, and welcome to Open Knowledge Melbourne. 

We run these events to continue our mission of building a community around openness: promoting the free sharing of information between government, universities, citizens, the media, and other organisations. 

The Open Knowledge ambassadors here tonight are: Fiona, digital humanities specialist and last year's Govhack Melbourne organiser; Steve, open data advocate and mapping enthusiast; Maia, community builder and open science etc...

We're lucky to be hosted by Thoughtworks, a software consultancy with a strong interest in community engagement and socially beneficial projects. Please help yourself to drinks and snacks in the kitchen, but respect the space: put dishes straight in the dishwasher and don't disrupt anyone still at work. The recycling and rubbish bins are _wherever they are_, there are fire exits _here and here_, toilets are back out through the main entrance.

We care about making everyone feel welcome, so please check out the code of conduct on the Meetup page. We have a mailing list (also linked), and we're active on Twitter at @okfnau. Please talk to _point out organisers_ if you have any issues.

Is anyone here for the first time tonight? Would you like to introduce yourselves with your name, your special skill or superpower, and something you're looking for help with.

**Introductions**

Great! Tonight goes like this: our speaker will talk for about 15 minutes, then there's plenty of time for questions. Healthy snacks are in the kitchen from around 7pm, so meet someone you don't know, share a skill or ask around for a project to get involved in. If you want to quietly hack away on a project, you can do that in here. We wind up at 9.

Our speaker tonight is _introduce_.
